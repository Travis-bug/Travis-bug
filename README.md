## About Me ##
- 🎓 computer programming student at georgebrown college in my second year 
- 👀 I’m interested and very eager to learn from people with much more expirience than i have to build my skills and knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and advancing my skills in java, c# and python.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on a Hospital Management system that based on a database i created and manage.
- 💻 i recently also completed a java library called NegEx, a python inspired negative style indexing library. 
- ⚡ Fun fact i learn from illustrations faster than wordings or written text
